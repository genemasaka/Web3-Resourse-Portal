# Web3-Resourse-Portal💎💎💎

This project is a simple web3 site that allows users to share web3 related resources. It's great since the resources are stored on the blockchain🔗 and you can always
retreive important resources. It implements a smart contract📜 that stores the input value from the front-end 
on to the blockchain. The smart contract is deployed on the Rinkeby test network and any one with some Rinkeby ETH can interact with the dapp. 

The smart contract also randomly awards users with 0.0001 ETH(Rinkeby) for contributing resources. There is a buffer of 1 minute between submissions to prevent flooding 
the smart contract.

The front end is built using react. You can find the deployed Dapp at: https://resource-portal.masakagene.repl.co/

Please interact with the dapp and share valuable web3 resources.🙌
